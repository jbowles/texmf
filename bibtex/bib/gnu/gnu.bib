%%%                        The initial draft of this bibliography was

%%%                        Proceedings, and WorldCat databases.
%%%                        Additions were then made from all of the
%%%                        bibliographies in the TeX User Group
%%%                        collection, from the Uncover library

%%%                        bibliography collection on ftp.ira.uka.de in

%%%                        Regrettably, the OCLC databases often do not

                 extension) is an extension language based on the Icon
                 programming language. Like Lisp-style EMACS extension
                 languages, it can be used to define key bindings.
                 Unlike those extensions, QUICHE is not bound to any
                 particular application, can easily make system calls
                 and invoke programs and can call entry points in the
                 program it is extending, either directly or through a
                 trait binding mechanism. It is this latter ability that
                 makes QUICHE an ideal means of unifying application
                 interfaces. Traits are defined for applications such as
                 window managers, debuggers and editors. Each trait
                 encapsulates a set of basic operations that will be
                 available in any instance of an object. The existence
                 of a standard set of traits allows the interface
                 designer to tailor interfaces that provide consistency
                 across multiple applications, and to easily modify or
                 add features to a set of applications. In addition,
                 QUICHE can also extend applications which do not
                 themselves support any traits. A manager can be written
                 in QUICHE that, instead of calling the application,
                 inserts the commands corresponding to a call as though
                 the user had entered them.",

                 science for a way of collecting and using libraries of
                 standard software components. The limited success in
                 actually doing this stems not from any resistance to
                 the idea, nor from any lack of trying, but rather from
                 the difficulty of choosing an appropriate formalism for
                 representing components. For a formalism to be
                 maximally useful, it must satisfy five key desiderata:
                 expressiveness, convenient combinability, semantic
                 soundness, machine manipulability, and programming
                 language independence. The Plan Calculus formalism
                 developed as part of the Programmer's Apprentice
                 project satisfies each of these desiderata quite well.
                 It does this by combining the ideas from flowchart
                 schemas, data abstraction, logical formalisms, and
                 program transformations. The efficacy of the Plan

                 Programmer's Apprentice project is to develop a theory
                 of programming and to automate the programming process.
                 Recognizing that fully automatic programming is very
                 far off, the current research is directed toward the
                 intermediate goal of developing an intelligent computer
                 assistant for programmers called the Programmer's
                 Apprentice (PA). The intention is for the PA to act as
                 a junior partner and critic, keeping track of details
                 and assisting with the easy parts of the programming
                 process while the programmer focuses on the hard part
                 of the process. The Knowledge-Based Editor in Emacs
                 (KBEmacs) is the current demonstration system
                 implemented as part of the PA project. KBEmacs is
                 capable of operating on Ada and Lisp programs of
                 realistic size and complexity. The principal benefit of
                 KBEmacs is that it makes it possible to construct a
                 program rapidly and reliably by combining algorithmic
                 fragments stored in a library. The heart of the paper
                 is a scenario showing the currently running KBEmacs
                 system in action. The scenario shows a 58 line Ada
                 program being constructed using six simple KBEmacs
                 commands. In addition the paper discusses the basic

                 by Sun Microsystems, is made up of a collection of
                 programming tools and libraries that implement a
                 powerful programming environment for Common Lisp. The
                 central component of the system is the SPE Lisp editor.
                 It is implemented in the style of Emacs, in that it is
                 built up from a set of character and buffer managing
                 primitives in a way that is user-extensible. Because
                 the system is written completely in Common Lisp, the
                 majority of its functionality is readily portable to
                 any full Common Lisp implementation. Some of interfaces
                 the SPE depends on, such as the debugger, depend on
                 lower level extensions to Common Lisp. But these also
                 have turned out to be quantifiable. The Symbolic
                 Programming Environment is an example of an
                 architecture for future workstation-based productivity
                 tools. Like the Common Lisp system it is built on, the
                 SPE is designed for evolution. Inherent in its
                 structure is the capability for it to extend,
                 transform, and grow in a variety of directions far
                 beyond those initially intended by its developers.",

                 direct editing of tree structures. This is implemented
                 as a new major mode, tree-mode. In tree-mode, trees are

                 current node of the tree (tree-point). Each node in the

                 Emacs text editing commands apply to the text of the

                 motivation for constructing Leif, and how Leif works
                 internally. A short introduction is then given to GNU
                 Emacs. To show to use Leif with Emacs key bindings,
                 examples are presented of the commands in Leif. The
                 authors also describes using Leif in the VIP mode of
                 GNU Emacs (VIP mode simulates the editor Vi within
                 Emacs). They describe commands that use the tree
                 structure of the edited program. Emacs variables are
                 listed that allow the behavior of Leif in Emacs to be
                 customized. An appendix contains an example {.emacs}

                 their goals and implementations, all of them ultimately
                 depend on some kind of remote procedure call (RPC), a
                 facility which is not easily supported by C++. For this
                 reason, many different extensions to C++ have been
                 implemented, each one coping with this problem in its
                 own, unique way. The paper presents a construct, called
                 a wrapper, which provides a more general solution to
                 the problem than previous work, and in some cases,

                 the existing systems are a significant aid to authors,
                 their designs are not sufficient to handle the demands
                 that have arisen with their continued use. These

                 enhanced reference inspection facility supporting
                 WYSIWYG display of references. The design and

                 these text editors let you customize them in nearly
                 limitless ways. Each of them manages the complexity of
                 customization by dividing itself into the kernel and
                 user layers. The kernel is the executable file you run
                 from the DOS command line. It manages machine
                 resources, implements basic operations involving files,
                 buffers, and windows, and supports the user layer. The
                 user layer is a set of files containing code written in
                 the editor's extension language and executed by the
                 kernel. It implements key bindings, search-and-replace
                 protocols, and language-sensitive modes.",

                 separate sub-systems; a Computer Algebra System using
                 the symbolic algebra system MACSYMA, a Rule-Based
                 Expert System using the Personal Consultant Expert
                 System from Texas Instruments, and an On-line Help

                 what he or she wants to do, which becomes the goal of
                 the consultation. This goal is refined by a series of
                 questions posed in the form of multiple choice menus.
                 The information in the menus is structured similarly to
                 an algebra and calculus textbook, and its organization
                 is intended to be intuitively apparent to a physical
                 scientist. The system requires very little knowledge of
                 the syntax or functions of the underlying CA system,
                 making it suitable for the novice user. At the same

                 therefore useful to the more advanced user. The system

                 grammar (TAG) as a formalism for the evaluation of
                 command language organization. TAG is a competence
                 model of command language organization which emphasizes
                 the structural organization of the command language.
                 That is, a group of commands all with the same form but
                 differing values is predicted to be easier to use than
                 one where each command of the group has a unique
                 pattern of values. The four test command languages they
                 used were: 'structure and mnemonics'; 'structure only';
                 'mnemonics only'; and a version of the EMACS editor
                 command language. A fifth language was added to the
                 testing, 'neither structure nor mnemonics'. Contrary to
                 the original results, in the replication, the
                 structural factor was not a significant factor. In
                 fact, the structure-only language, the EMACS variant
                 and the language with neither structure nor mnemonics
                 were not significantly different. Considering only the
                 languages with structure, the use of word abbreviations
                 as mnemonics appears to be more effective than the use
                 of graphical symbols. As TAG depends on the explanation
                 of the importance of structure, this finding raises
                 questions as to its utility. A categorization exercise
                 gave the only result which showed any influence of the
                 structure factor. If TAG does provide a performance
                 model of command languages, it appears to have much
                 less influence on the user's performance than some
                 types of mnemonics. The EMACS variant has more complex
                 organization than any other of the test languages. The
                 test results do not show that the subjects were able to
                 use the clues provided.",

                 general purpose tree editor must include the following
                 features. It must not be restricted to applications
                 where the trees are defined by formal grammars. On the
                 other hand, it must be able to check and/or enforce
                 structural constraints on trees. It must allow for
                 varying the representation of trees both within and
                 between applications. It must be extensible and
                 customizable. It must be possible to vary the time(s)
                 at which structure constraints are checked: continually
                 (i.e. at each tree modification), by user command, or

                 paradigm of format conversion, in which scanned
                 document images are converted into a structured
                 symbolic description which can be manipulated by a
                 conventional document processing system. While this
                 approach is attractive in many respects, there are
                 situations in which complete recognition and format
                 conversion is either unnecessary or very difficult to
                 achieve with sufficient accuracy. The authors describe
                 Image EMACS, a text editor for binary document images
                 which illustrates an alternative to the format
                 conversion paradigm. The inputs and outputs of Image
                 EMACS are scanned images of text and the primary
                 document representation within Image EMACS is the image
                 itself, rather than a symbolic description of it. The
                 goal of Image EMACS is to allow images of text to be
                 created and manipulated as if they were conventional
                 text files. The central insight behind Image EMACS is
                 that many text editing operations may be implemented
                 directly in terms of geometrical operations on image
                 blobs, without explicit knowledge of the symbolic

                 presented approach to checkpointing is programmer,
                 operating system, and hardware transparent.
                 Compile-time information is exploited to maintain the
                 desired checkpoint interval and to reduce the size of
                 checkpoints. Compiler-generated sparse potential
                 checkpoint code is used to maintain the desired
                 checkpoint interval. Adaptive checkpointing has been
                 developed to reduce the size of checkpoints by
                 exploiting potentially large variations in memory
                 usage. A training technique is used in selecting the
                 low-cost, high-coverage potential checkpoints. Since
                 the potential checkpoint selection problem is
                 NP-complete, a heuristic algorithm has been developed

                 C++. It translates an $n$-element user-specified

                 uniquely maps keywords in $W$ onto the range

                 $k$-element static lookup table and either a pair of C
                 functions or a C++ class. The generated code determines

                 possible in part due to the advent of high-performance
                 architecture-independent compiler technology. To
                 demonstrate the method, seven benchmarks are
                 characterized. Five of the benchmarks are from the SPEC

                 of experience with object-oriented programming. Most
                 current implementations include a comfortable suite of
                 Lisp support tools including an Emacs lisp editor, an
                 interpreter, an incremental compiler, a debugger, and
                 an inspector which together promote rapid prototyping
                 and design. What else might one want from a system? We
                 argue that static typing yields earlier error
                 detection, greater robustness, and higher efficiency
                 and that greater simplicity and more orthogonality in
                 the language constructs leads to a shorter learning
                 curve and more intuitive programming. These elements
                 can be found in Eiffel and a new object-oriented
                 language, Sather, that we are developing at ICSI.
                 Language simplicity and static typing are not for free,
                 though. Programmers have to pay with loss of
                 polymorphism and flexibility in prototyping. We give a
                 short comparison of CLOS, Eiffel and Sather, addressing
                 both language and environment issues. The different
                 approaches taken by the languages described in this
                 paper have evolved to fulfill different needs. While we
                 have only touched on the essential differences, we hope
                 that this discussion will be helpful in understanding
                 the advantages and disadvantages of each language.",

                 hyper text system), a multiuser hypertext system for
                 collaboration. EHTS consists of a text editor, a
                 graphical browser, and an active hypertext database
                 named HyperBase. HyperBase is built on the
                 client-server model and has been designed especially to
                 support collaboration among its users, by providing an
                 event mechanism and a fine-grained lock mechanism.
                 Events from HyperBase are used to notify the editor and
                 browser about important actions on the shared data,
                 enabling them to monitor changes. Four categories of
                 issues from the design and experiences from the use of
                 EHTS are reported: architecture, collaboration, user
                 interface, and data model. Based on experiences with
                 the client-server model, the author suggests a new and
                 improved architecture for the event driven multiuser
                 hypertext system. One major lesson learned is that
                 events and fine-grained locks can provide powerful
                 support for data sharing among multiple users
                 simultaneously working in the same environment. The
                 need for a flexible data model is another lesson
                 learned. It is difficult to predict what data model
                 objects actually will be needed, when the data model is

                 The goal of WCL is to allow hundreds of Lisp
                 applications to be realistically available at once,
                 while allowing several of them to run concurrently. WCL
                 accomplishes this by providing Common Lisp as a UNIX
                 shared library that can be linked with Lisp and C code
                 to produce efficient applications. For example, the

                 World!' program requires only 40k bytes under SunOS 4.1

                 predicate logic using polymorphism and recursion, the
                 main singular properties of this logic are those
                 derived from the mu -operator, used to define
                 recursion, and from the type variables and type
                 constructors. The semantics of the recursive functions
                 is based on the fixpoint theory whereas the ideas for
                 the semantics of the polymorphism are near to those for
                 a Horn clause logic. With this computational logic as

                 of routines into modules within the system. An approach
                 known as the object finder exits to assist the
                 programmer in understanding the structure and data of a
                 program based on the object-like features found in the

                 kinds of design principles and system structure from
                 its source code. The object finder looks for clusters

                 the objects and object classes of object-oriented

                 semantic net and is then placed into the four hypertext
                 systems: Emacs-Info, Guide, HyperTies, and SuperBook.
                 The first-order Guide and SuperBook hypertexts reflect
                 a depth-first traversal of the semantic net, and the
                 Emacs-Info and HyperTies hypertexts reflect a
                 breadth-first traversal. The semantic net is augmented
                 manually, and then new traversal programs automatically
                 generate alternate outlines. An index based on word
                 patterns in the textbook is also automatically
                 generated for the second-order hypertext. Our suite of
                 programs has been applied to a published textbook, and
                 the resulting hypertexts are publicly available.",

                 anatomy of the design of undo support in the GNU Emacs
                 environment. Apart from providing design guidelines for
                 undo support, it illustrates how to bring a design from
                 an abstract conception to a concrete realization and
                 how to balance trade-offs in the process. Undo support
                 is a usability feature of interactive computer systems
                 which allows a user to reverse the effects of executed
                 commands. GNU Emacs was chosen as a suitable
                 environment to demonstrate how to design undo support
                 because of its sophistication and practical
                 significance. User's opinions about which aspects of
                 the existing undo support facility in Emacs need to be
                 improved were solicited by conducting an informal
                 survey among Emacs users. The results of the survey are
                 discussed and were used to tailor a proposal for an
                 improved undo support facility for Emacs. In order to
                 test the adequacy of the proposal, it was subjected to
                 an informal expert walk-through and a review of Emacs
                 users opinions was conducted through a computer
                 network. These evaluations are discussed and revisions
                 to the proposal elicited. After the revised prototype
                 of the design was implemented, a post-mortem evaluation
                 was carried out and its results were incorporated in
                 the final implementation.",

                 foundation language in about 100 institutions; thus,
                 several thousand students a year begin their higher
                 education with Ada. Ada is taught, somewhere in the

                 number grows each year. Important factors in this
                 growth are: the availability of nearly two dozen Ada
                 texts oriented to undergraduate courses; the
                 availability of inexpensive and free Ada compilers;

                 dependence graph that contains a program's control
                 flow, along with the usual control and data dependence
                 information. The algorithm constructs a program
                 dependence graph while the program is being parsed. For
                 programs containing only structured transfers of
                 control, the algorithm does not require information
                 provided by the control flow graph or post dominator
                 trees and therefore obviates the construction of these
                 auxiliary graphs. For programs containing explicit
                 transfers of control, the algorithm adjusts the partial
                 control dependence subgraph, constructed during the
                 parse, to incorporate exact control dependence
                 information. There are several advantages to the
                 approach. The algorithm may result in substantial
                 savings in time and memory since the construction of
                 the program dependence graph does not require the
                 auxiliary graph. Furthermore, since the authors
                 incorporate control and data flow as well as exact
                 control dependence information into the program
                 dependence graph, the graph has a wide range of
                 applicability. They have implemented the algorithm by

  abstract =     "A great interest has developed in recent years in
                 building tools that allow people to collaborate on work
                 without the need for physical proximity. One such class
                 of tools, group editors, allows collaborators to view
                 and edit a shared document simultaneously from their
                 workstations. Building group editors, however, requires
                 solving non-trivial problems such as providing adequate
                 response time for edit operations and yet ensuring
                 consistency with concurrent updates, and providing
                 adequate per-user undo facilities. The authors have
                 implemented a toolkit, called DistEdit, for building
                 new interactive group editors and for converting
                 existing single-user editors into group editors with
                 minimal changes to their code. The toolkit allows
                 different users to use their favorite editors to edit a
                 shared file and observe each others' changes as they
                 occur. The toolkit provides fine-grain concurrency
                 control, fault-tolerance, synchronization of views, and
                 support for per-user undo. The authors describe the
                 detailed design and implementation of the DistEdit
                 toolkit and report their experiences in converting
                 several editors, including GNU Emacs and Xedit, to
                 group editors using the toolkit.",

                 are either extremely simple or too difficult for the

                 messages are often too narrow in context for the expert

                 months we ported Sprite to run as a server on top of
                 the Mach 3.0 microkernel. Although the resulting server
                 does not implement some Sprite features, it can run in
                 an existing Sprite cluster, and it supports standard
                 UNIX programs like vi, gcc, and make. Porting Sprite to
                 Mach was generally straightforward, though there were
                 some difficulties. Many of the problems were related to
                 asynchronous interactions between the Sprite server,
                 Mach, and Sprite user processes. Others resulted from
                 trying to maintain native Sprite's internal interfaces
                 in the Sprite server. The Sprite server is 22\% smaller
                 than an equivalent Sprite kernel, and it contains
                 almost no machine-dependent code. These improvements
                 should significantly simplify porting Sprite to new
                 hardware platforms. Unfortunately, the Sprite server
                 runs the Andrew benchmark at only 38\% of the speed of
                 native Sprite. None of the performance problems appears

                 processing database queries. The database is assumed to
                 be relational and the different relations comprising
                 the database may, if necessary, reside on different
                 computers (linked in a network). The author
                 investigates the feasibility of using concurrency
                 synchronized by data flow constraints. At the top
                 level, the database query manager/interpreter is
                 written in Strand. Upon interpreting a given query,
                 this manager evolves into a network of processes
                 appropriate to the efficient processing of the query.
                 The manager's lower level routines are derived from
                 those of the GNU dbm library. Overall, this approach
                 combines the elegance of programming in a declarative,
                 parallel language with the efficiency of using existing
                 database routines written in C. The author presents an
                 overview of the Strand programming environment and
                 describes the particular database upon which some
                 example queries are based. He covers the processing of
                 a specific query in detail describing the network of
                 processors that result upon interpreting the query and
                 the concurrency exploited in processing the query. He
                 presents other examples of query processing and
                 compares the present approach with an earlier approach

                 intermediate point between the bitmap editing and
                 format conversion paradigms. The aim of Image EMACS is
                 to provide familiar high level editing commands in a
                 context that preserves document appearance except where
                 the commands are actually applied. The inputs and
                 outputs of Image EMACS are binary images of text. The
                 primary document representation within Image EMACS is a
                 collection of image elements extracted through simple
                 geometrical analysis, rather than an abstract symbolic
                 description of the image. Image EMACS is based on a
                 principle of minimal interpretation: perform image
                 analysis only to the extent necessary to carry out
                 operations explicitly requested by the user. Adherence
                 to this principle avoids the format conversion problems
                 previously noted. Our approach also builds on existing
                 networks and protocols for communicating document
                 images and provides a natural and smoothly evolving
                 path from paper-based work flows toward the ubiquitous
                 use and interchange of electronic documents. Image

                 Tk toolkit in Perl5. Nothing passes through the Tcl

                 heavily on the object oriented features of Perl5 (which
                 is itself only just into beta test), the paper explains
                 how Perl5 implements classes, objects and methods. It

                 GNU C, which provides several extensions that are
                 important for Forth implementation. The indirect
                 threaded Forth engine is completely
                 machine-independent, direct threading requires a few
                 lines machine-specific lines for each machine. Using a
                 portable language like GNU C encourages producing an
                 engine with many primitives. In order to make the
                 development of primitives easier and less error-prone,
                 an automatic tool generates most of the code for a
                 Forth primitive from the stack effect notation, even if
                 the TOS is kept in a register. The engine is combined
                 with the parts of the system written in Forth by
                 loading a machine-independent image file that contains
                 the executable Forth code in relocatable form.",

                 contain repeated text in the form of large and small
                 blocks that appear in more or less the same form in
                 several places. These repetitions define a structure
                 that can contribute information about the development
                 history of the source different from the documented
                 version or the current directory structure. A strategy
                 based on fingerprinting is used to obtain raw matches
                 indicating where repetitions occur. The information
                 inherent in these matches is then reorganized for
                 easier processing, leading to a natural clustering of
                 substrings. Suppression of detail is usually necessary
                 to make further progress and can be done in several
                 different ways. For example, matches of blocks of text
                 identify associations within groups of files. In cases
                 with complex clusters of files involving multiple

                 provide significant insights into the structure of the
                 redundancy and hence the source. The paper discusses
                 this approach and shows results obtained from an

                 its compiler generates compact and efficient object
                 codes. However slight bugs (pitfall) which cannot be
                 detected by the compiler may cause a serious error in C
                 programs. We are developing a software tool Fall-in C
                 to detect such pitfalls. The paper demonstrates the
                 basic features of Fall-in C. In order to enable a
                 programmer to correct the detected pitfalls
                 immediately, Fall-in C is executed within GNU Emacs
                 editor. Pitfalls in C programs are mainly ad hoc. Thus
                 we prepare three pitfall detection methods for the
                 extensibility of Fall-in C: regular expression
                 searching, structural pattern matching and message
                 analysis of external programs. The patterns for the
                 first two methods can be easily added to Fall-in C.
                 Furthermore the message analysis method can be used to
                 integrate several C program checkers such as lint,
                 check and cchk into Fall-in C.",

  abstract =     "In information extraction tasks, a finite-state
                 pattern matcher is widely used to identify individual
                 pieces of information in a sentence. Merging related
                 pieces of information scattered throughout a text is
                 usually difficult, however, since semantic relations
                 across sentences cannot be captured by the sentence
                 level processing. The purpose of the discourse
                 processing described in this paper is to link
                 individual pieces of information identified by the
                 sentence level processing. In the Tipster information
                 extraction domains, correct identification of company
                 names is the key to achieving a high level of system
                 performance. Therefore, the discourse processor in the
                 Textract information extraction system keeps track of
                 missing, abbreviated, and referenced company names in
                 order to correlate individual pieces of information
                 throughout the text. Furthermore, the discourse is
                 segmented, so that data can be extracted from relevant
                 portions of the text containing information of interest

                 paper discusses a program compression methodology based
                 on existing processor architectures. The authors
                 examine practical and theoretical measures for the
                 maximum compression rate of a suite of programs across
                 six modern architectures. The theoretical compression
                 rate is reported in terms of the zeroth and first-order
                 entropies, while the practical compression rate is
                 reported in terms of the Huffman-encoded format of the
                 proposed compression methodology and the GNU file
                 compression utility, gzip. These experiments indicate
                 that a practical increase of 15\%--30\% and a
                 theoretical increase of over 100\% in code density can
                 be expected using the techniques examined. In addition,

                 difficult to program in high-level languages such as C.
                 Numerical C, a new high-level language built on the
                 Free Software Foundation's GNU C compiler (gcc), makes
                 it easier to program DSP applications and related
                 mathematical algorithms. It is easy to use, and it also
                 makes it easier to produce better code for the target.
                 Numerical C is a superset of ANSI-standard C. It
                 differs from Standard C in that the additional language
                 constructs are geared to mathematical-programming
                 paradigms. These constructs enable the compiler to
                 generate more-efficient code by giving the compiler
                 more information about the algorithm and by enforcing a
                 canonical form on the input program. The most important
                 extensions that have been added to gcc include
                 operators, data types, and iterators. This article

                 of a consistent checkpointing mechanism that has been
                 integrated into a modular Mach microkernel based
                 operating system. We have measured the performance
                 overhead of checkpointing for several
                 workstation-typical applications: number crunching and
                 office tools. This has been done using specific servers
                 which were added to a standard Mach 3.0/BSD system.
                 Measurements are performed for failure-free executions
                 by varying the number of checkpoints and thus the
                 amount of computation lost in the event of a crash. Our
                 initial results showed a time overhead of about 3\% for
                 up to 20\% work lost in the event of a crash, while we
                 get an overhead between 16\% and 23\% for up to 1\%
                 computation lost. Also, when porting interactive office
                 tools such as the micro-emacs text editor, we get a
                 maximal checkpoint duration of 1.4 second on our
                 prototype machine that is as powerful as a Sun 3/60.
                 Based on these results, we argue that checkpointing can
                 be integrated into a modular micro-kernel based

  abstract =     "The programming language C has a flexible structure
                 and its compiler generates compact and efficient object
                 codes. However the compiler cannot detect some types of
                 bugs hidden in the program. We are developing a
                 software tool Fall-in C to detect such types of bugs,
                 or pitfalls, in C programs. In contrast with lint,
                 Fall-in C is executed within GNU Emacs editor in order
                 to enable a programmer to correct the detected pitfalls
                 immediately. Furthermore Fall-in C uses pattern
                 matching for pitfall detection so that programmers can
                 augment the detectable pitfall types by adding the
                 corresponding patterns. Fall-in C uses both regular
                 expression searching and structural pattern matching in
                 order to detect pitfalls in C programs. A regular
                 expression can efficiently detect lexical pitfalls
                 while it detects erroneous pitfalls during syntactic
                 pitfall detection. Although structural pattern matching
                 requires syntactic analysis and thus cannot detect
                 certain types of lexical pitfalls, it can properly
                 detect syntactic pitfalls. We evaluated the tool using
                 180 C source files (2.9 MB total) and demonstrated that
                 Fall-in C correctly detects 16 types of pitfalls.",

                 construction and modification of programs in terms of
                 standard algorithmic fragments (cliches), instead of
                 merely in terms of syntactic or textual units. Three
                 experimental cliche-based program editors have been
                 implemented, exploring the tradeoff between power and
                 speed. (1) The Knowledge-Based Editor in Emacs
                 (KBEmacs) supports a wide range of editing operations
                 and can represent a wide range of cliches, because it
                 uses an internal representation called plan diagrams,
                 which combines features of flowcharts and data flow
                 schemas. Unfortunately, the need to convert back and
                 forth between program text and plan diagrams causes
                 KBEmacs to be quite slow. (2) The Tempest editor uses
                 text as its internal representation and is very fast
                 since it does not have to do any conversions. It
                 supports a number of cliche-based operations and can
                 represent a variety of cliches. Unfortunately, most
                 programming cliches are too complex to be supported
                 directly in terms of program text. (3) The Ace editor
                 retains much of the speed of Tempest while supporting
                 much of the power of KBEmacs. Ace is relatively
                 efficient, because it uses abstract syntax trees as its
                 internal representation. Ace's approach could be used
                 to add powerful and efficient cliche-based editing
                 capabilities to any programming environment. In
                 particular, Ace demonstrates that a small change in the
                 internal workings of syntax editors is all that is
                 required to open the door to cliche-based editing.",

                 decade. All the software in the GNU corpus has been

  abstract =     "Many users of symbolic algebra systems have felt the
                 need for greater CPU power. Yet few of them have
                 ventured into parallel programming due to the steep
                 learning curve and the unfamiliar programming
                 environment entailed by such an effort. In an attempt
                 to remedy that situation, the parallel library MPI has
                 been integrated into both GCL (GNU Common LISP) and GAP
                 (a general purpose language for mathematical group
                 theory). These implementations are examples that extend
                 bindings of MPI to interactive languages. (MPI already
                 has bindings to the compiled languages C and FORTRAN.)
                 Further, this binding to an interactive language
                 retains the interactive environment during execution.
                 Further, STAR/MPI represents a blueprint for binding
                 MPI to other interactive languages besides GCL and GAP,
                 from which comes the name STAR/MPI, or */MPI. STAR/MPI
                 includes a simple SPMD architecture on top of this MPI
                 binding. An important class of sequential algorithms is
                 described that can be parallelized with little effort
                 using STAR/MPI architecture. Since GAP is
                 representative of systems for discrete mathematics and
                 LISP is the basis for several symbolic algebra systems
                 with strengths in nondiscrete mathematics, it is hoped
                 to gain broad feedback on the issues involved. Although
                 vendor-specific, interactive, parallel languages exist,
                 this appears to be the first attempt at defining a
                 binding of a vendor-independent, portable, parallel
                 library to arbitrary interactive languages.",

                 control flow, local dataflow and symbol table
                 information for procedural language programs. We
                 implemented a parser for C by incorporating analysis
                 routines into the GNU C parser; a C++ parser is being
                 implemented using similar techniques, Aristotle tools
                 use the data provided by the parsers to perform a

                 dependence analysis, dataflow testing, graph

  abstract =     "A highly parallel single-chip image signal processor
                 architecture has been derived by analysis of image
                 processing algorithms. Available levels of parallelism
                 and their associated demands on data access, control
                 and complexity of operations were taken into account.
                 The RISC architecture, called 'HiPAR-DSP', consists of
                 a control unit, 16 parallel ASIMD-controlled data paths
                 with autonomous addressing and instruction selection
                 capability, a local data cache per data path, a shared
                 memory with matrix type data access and a powerful
                 DMA-unit. The proposed architecture was designed by
                 assessing the results of an analysis of characteristic
                 algorithm properties with respect to their inherent
                 parallelization resources, achievable speed up and
                 implementation costs. This resulted in a proper balance
                 between the degree of parallelism and flexibility,
                 leading to a high performance for a wide field of
                 applications. Additional measures were taken to support
                 an efficient high level programmability of the
                 processor. This was achieved by the concurrent
                 implementation of special architectural features and a
                 C++-programming environment. It consists of an
                 adaptation of the GNU C++-compiler and an optimizing
                 assembler, supporting all levels of concurrency offered
                 by the hardware. While most levels of parallelization
                 are kept invisible to the programmer, data-level
                 parallelism is expressed by the programmer using
                 special new data types added to the standard
                 C/C++-data-types. A sustained performance of about 2.0
                 Gigaoperations per second is achieved by the 100 MHz
                 clocked processor for numerous image processing
                 algorithms, leading to a processing time e.g. for a
                 normalized correlation of a 512*512 image with a 32*32
                 correlation mask of 450 ms. Thus, a performance is
                 achieved with a programmable parallel processor
                 architecture that hitherto required the application of
                 a dedicated integrated circuit.",

                 that they can undo actions and restore previous states
                 if necessary. A text-editor, like EMACS, where users
                 can restore the state of an editing session to a
                 correct previous state, is an example of such a system.
                 Editors for textual, graphical, and many other media

                 understanding of recovery in applications that use
                 audio is not as widespread. Audio is characterized by
                 its large volume, lack of easy indexing, and difficulty
                 in defining inverse operations. We present a
                 theoretical model of recovery for audio operations to
                 help user interface designers and implementors. Our
                 model maps an audio operation to a recovery policy and
                 then the recovery policy to a recovery mechanism. The

  abstract =     "Engineers doing embedded systems work are wondering if
                 their next project should use a high-level language
                 such as C rather than assembly language. The advantages
                 are shorter development time, potentially more readable
                 (and maintainable) code, and more capability to handle
                 large, complicated software systems. This article is
                 intended to be used by embedded systems engineers who
                 are making the transition from working in assembly
                 language to C. The article is also aimed at software
                 engineers who have had no need to examine assembly
                 language listings, because of the prevalence of source
                 code debuggers. The article demonstrates the specifics
                 of recognizing most of the major high-level language
                 constructs in an assembly listing. Examples and a short
                 program are analyzed, using the output of a typical
                 embedded compiler and the output of the GNU C compiler,
                 a well-known optimizing compiler. Also included is a
                 general background on how C compilers work, how they
                 translate source code into assembly language
                 statements, and the layout of a program's components in

  abstract =     "The design and implementation of an object-oriented
                 simulation environment, OZ, for the Superconducting
                 Super Collider (SSC) Laboratory is described in this
                 paper. The design applies object-oriented technology to
                 data management and visualization, behavior modeling,
                 and dynamic simulation. A simulation framework called
                 InterSim is proposed to model and simulate different
                 types of objects in large systems by their
                 functionality during the development of OZ. Our
                 framework supports encapsulation, code reuse, and a
                 loosely coupled development approach. A framework is a
                 collection of classes that are cohesive and
                 self-contained to provide a set of services for a
                 particular domain. InterSim provides four conceptual
                 layers of classes in the design of a simulation
                 environment. The design of each layer can proceed
                 independently, based on a set of predefined
                 responsibilities and protocols between each layer. Our
                 goal is to accumulatively create a complete
                 functionality within each layer for reuse in future
                 software development. OZ provides a graphical user
                 interface that allows the user to visualize the design
                 data as objects in the database and to interactively
                 model system components through direct manipulation.
                 Modeling can be exercised at different levels of the
                 system decomposition hierarchy before it is dynamically
                 bound into a system for simulation. Inheritance is used
                 to derive new behavior of the system or subsystem from
                 the existing one. The implementation uses C++, GLISTK
                 library, InterViews 2.6, ISTK library, GNU C++ library,
                 and the ObjectStore database management system.",

  abstract =     "Presents an implementation of the POSIX/UNIX95 CRC
                 (cyclic redundancy checking) algorithm in Ada95. Our
                 purpose is three-fold. (1) We want to provide standard
                 source code that can be recompiled on any platform,
                 UNIX-like or not, and be reused by other projects. (2)
                 We want the implementation to be generic and scalable,
                 typically from a 16-bit up to a 64- bit CRC checksum.
                 This goal is achieved by designing a generic
                 implementation, of which the POSIX/UNIX95 CRC is a
                 specific 32-bit instantiation, based on previous well-
                 designed and optimized work done in C. (3) The
                 implementation illustrates some of the new features of
                 the Ada95 language: shifting and rotating procedures,
                 modular types, aliased accesses, generic formal
                 package, child packages, exception information, etc.
                 Computing CRC checksums has proven difficult and slow
                 to execute in Ada83. The generic implementation of CRC
                 checksums illustrates some powerful and easy-to-use
                 features of Ada95. The algorithm is scalable up to any
                 octuple CRC size. Both 16-bit and 32-bit instances are
                 provided; 64-bit (or higher) can be created if
                 necessary. The CRC32 instance is fully compatible with
                 the POSIX/UNIX95 specification. The implementation is
                 quite fast. However, there is no way it can be any
                 faster than one done in hardware or one that relies on
                 a low-level language. Speed alone was not the premium;
                 instead, we mainly focused on portability, openness,
                 reuse and scalability issues. The presented code has
                 been compiled with the currently available version of
                 the GNAT compiler for DOS. It has been unit tested
                 against existing C implementations (5 Refs.)",

                 successfully ported to several superscalar
                 microprocessors. For that purpose, the instruction
                 timing of the target processor was usually modeled in a
                 straightforward manner. Unfortunately, in our
                 experience, this is likely to lead the instruction
                 scheduler astray. In this paper, we describe some of
                 our experiments that revealed such flaws, concerning
                 the DEC Alpha 21064 as well as other superscalar RISC
                 processors. We analyze the circumstances that led to
                 poorly scheduled code and demonstrate how the machine
                 description supplied for a superscalar processor can be
                 modified to fit some of these problems without
                 hampering the portability of the GCC. On the other
                 hand, we show situations for which we do not have a

                 has garnered increasing attention in the legal field
                 over the past number of years. It provides a
                 paradigmatically different model of software
                 development and marketing than proprietary software,
                 which has traditionally been protected by copyright,
                 and latterly, also by patent law. Licensing styles of
                 free or OSS vary greatly from the very permissive,
                 where users can privatise their modifications, to the
                 quite restrictive, where programmers are obliged to
                 contribute any changes they make to a communal software
                 pool, which forms a species of expanding virtual
                 commons. Examples of the former include BSD Unix
                 licences and of the latter the GNU General Public
                 Licence (GNU GPL), well known for being the licence
                 used for the Linux operating system. This Article
                 distinguishes between free software and OSS, discusses
                 free and OSS licensing, comparing a BSD licence with
                 the GNU GPL in order to illustrate the varying
                 parameters which different programmers put in place to
                 protect their programs. It also analyses the efficacy
                 of the GNU GPL both from strictly legal and broader
                 socio-legal perspectives. It concludes that this
                 licence has facilitated an efficacious and productive
                 management of what could otherwise have turned into an
                 obsolete and deficient commons.",

                 programming, as a companion to Knuth's book, or just
                 for fun!\par

                 The MIX's architecture is a simplified version of real
                 CISC CPUs. It features registers, memory cells, an
                 overflow toggle, comparison flags, input-output
                 devices, and a set of binary instructions executable by
                 its virtual CPU. It is powerful and complete enough to
                 provide a virtual development platform for writing
                 quite complex programs, and useful for learning new

  abstract =     "IBM has designed special cryptographic processors for
                 its servers for more than 25 years. These began as very
                 simple devices, but over time the requirements have
                 become increasingly complex, and there has been a
                 never-ending demand for increased speed. This paper
                 describes the PCIXCC, the new coprocessor introduced in
                 the IBM z990 server. In many ways, PCIXCC is a
                 watershed design. For the first time, a single product
                 satisfies all requirements across all IBM server
                 platforms. It offers the performance demanded by
                 today's Web servers, it supports the complex and
                 specialized cryptographic functions needed in the
                 banking and finance industry, and it uses packaging
                 technology that leads the world in resistance to
                 physical or electrical attacks against its secure
                 processes and the secret data it holds. Furthermore, it

  abstract =     "For two decades, large parts of zSeries firmware have
                 been written in the PL8 programming language. The
                 existence of a large amount of mature zSeries firmware
                 source code and our excellent experience with PL8 for
                 system programming suggest keeping this language.
                 However, the firmware address space of today s zSeries
                 servers may exceed 2 GB, raising the need for a new
                 64-bit PL8 compiler, since the original implementation,
                 developed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center,
                 Yorktown Heights, New York, supports only 32-bit
                 platforms. The GNU compiler collection (GCC) (GNU is a
                 freeware UNIX -like operating system) has been used to
                 translate those parts of firmware written in C for some
                 years and has also proved successful in compiling Linux
                 for zSeries. This fact, combined with the highly
                 modular GCC design, suggested reimplementing PL8 within
                 the GCC framework. In this paper, we report on the
                 extension of PL8 to support 64-bit addressing, its
                 implementation as a GCC front end, and the validation
                 of the new compiler. We also evaluate PL8 as a language
                 for highly reliable low-level programming and give some
                 performance data. The paper documents the high level of
                 quality achieved by the GCC open-source project and how
                 such software fits into the traditional IBM software
                 development processes.",

  abstract =     "An attractive way to increase text compression is to
                 replace words with references to a text dictionary
                 given in advance. Although there exist a few works in
                 this area, they do not fully exploit the compression
                 possibilities or consider alternative preprocessing
                 variants for various compressors in the latter phase.
                 In this paper, we discuss several aspects of
                 dictionary-based compression, including compact
                 dictionary representation, and present a
                 PPM/BWCA-oriented scheme, word replacing
                 transformation, achieving compression ratios higher by
                 2-6\% than the state-of-the-art StarNT (2003) text
                 preprocessor, working at a greater speed. We also
                 present an alternative scheme designed for LZ77
                 compressors, with the advantage over StarNT of reaching
                 up to 14\% in combination with gzip.",

                 continuous or discrete solution sets are computed using
                 Cartesian products of intervals. Systems are given by
                 sets of equations or inequality constraints over
                 integer and real variables. Moreover, they may have
                 different natures, being square or nonsquare, sparse or
                 dense, linear, polynomial, or involving transcendental
                 functions.The modeling language permits stating
                 constraint models and tuning parameters of solving
                 algorithms which efficiently combine interval methods
                 and constraint satisfaction techniques. Several
                 consistency techniques (box, hull, and 3B) are
                 implemented. The distribution includes C sources,
                 executables for different machine architectures,

                 was introduced with the IBM z990 system, it laid the
                 foundation to move toward an open-standard development
                 environment for the i390 layer of IBM System z host
                 firmware. However, when the z990 system was developed,
                 the proprietary project development library system and
                 the table of contents object file format for i390 code
                 were still being used. With the IBM System z9e, we have
                 moved to a fully open-standard development environment.
                 This paper describes the steps we took to get there, to
                 improve code performance, development efficiency, and
                 regression testing, and to develop base functionality
                 for important System z9 features such as enhanced

                 complex standard functions is addressed in this
                 article. The functions under consideration are root and
                 power functions, the exponential, trigonometric and
                 hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For
                 such a function $f$ and a given rectangular complex
                 interval $z$, some interval $w$ is computed that
                 contains all function values of $f$ in $z$. This is
                 done by expressing the real and the imaginary part of
                 $f$ as compositions of real standard functions and then
                 estimating the ranges of these compositions. In many

                 context-insensitive pointer analysis. We present a
                 novel approach for precisely modelling struct variables
                 and indirect function calls. Our method emphasizes
                 efficiency and simplicity and is based on a simple
                 language of set constraints. We obtain an $O(v^4)$
                 bound on the time needed to solve a set of constraints
                 from this language, where $v$ is the number of
                 constraint variables. This gives, for the first time,
                 some insight into the hardness of performing
                 field-sensitive pointer analysis of C. Furthermore, we
                 experimentally evaluate the time versus precision
                 trade-off for our method by comparing against the
                 field-insensitive equivalent. Our benchmark suite
                 consists of 11 common C programs ranging in size from
                 15,000 to 200,000 lines of code. Our results indicate
                 the field-sensitive analysis is more expensive to
                 compute, but yields significantly better precision. In
                 addition, our technique has been integrated into the
                 latest release (version 4.1) of the GNU Compiler GCC.
                 Finally, we identify several previously unknown issues
                 with an alternative and less precise approach to
                 modelling struct variables, known as field-based
                 analysis.",

                 that new test cases can be added in bulk from existing

                 of correctness issues and for creating new test code by

                 unacceptable in the embedded world, where real-time
                 constraints, battery life-time, and production costs
