<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Hyperlatex </span>is a package that allows you to prepare documents in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>, and, at the same time, to
produce a neatly printed document from your input. Unlike some other systems that you may have seen,
Hyperlatex is <span 
class="cmti-10">not </span>a general <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>-to-<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>converter. In my eyes, conversion is not a solution to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>
authoring. A well written <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>document must differ from a printed copy in a number of rather subtle
ways&#8212;you&#8217;ll see many examples in this manual. I doubt that these differences can be recognized
mechanically, and I believe that converted <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> can never be as readable as a document written for
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   This manual is for Hyperlatex&#x00A0;2.6, of February&#x00A0;2002.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   The basic idea of Hyperlatex is to make it possible to write a document that will look like a flawless
<span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> document when printed and like a handwritten <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>document when viewed with an
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>browser. In this it completely follows the philosophy of <span 
class="cmtt-10">latexinfo </span>(and <span 
class="cmtt-10">texinfo</span>). Like
<span 
class="cmtt-10">latexinfo</span>, it defines its own input format&#8212;the <span 
class="cmti-10">Hyperlatex markup language</span>&#8212;and provides two
converters to turn a document written in Hyperlatex markup into a <span 
class="cmcsc-10">D<span 
class="small-caps">v</span><span 
class="small-caps">i</span> </span>file or a set of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>
documents.
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   Obviously, this approach has the disadvantage that you have to learn a &#8220;new&#8221; language to generate
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>files. However, the mental effort for this is quite limited. The Hyperlatex markup language is
simply a well-defined subset of <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> that has been extended with commands to create hyperlinks, to
control the conversion to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>, and to add concepts of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>such as horizontal rules and embedded
images. Furthermore, you can use Hyperlatex perfectly well without knowing anything about <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>
markup.
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   The fact that Hyperlatex defines only a restricted subset of <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> does not mean that you have to
restrict yourself in what you can do in the printed copy. Hyperlatex provides many commands that allow
you to include arbitrary <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> commands (including commands from any package that
you&#8217;d like to use) which will be processed to create your printed output, but which will be
ignored in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>document. However, you do have to specify that <span 
class="cmti-10">explicitly</span>. Whenever
Hyperlatex encounters a <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> command outside its restricted subset, it will complain

bitterly.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   The rationale behind this is that when you are writing your document, you should keep both the
printed document and the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>output in mind. Whenever you want to use a <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> command with no
defined <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>equivalent, you are thus forced to specify this equivalent. If, for instance, you have marked
a logical separation between paragraphs with <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>&#8217;s <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\bigskip</span></span></span> command (a command not in
Hyperlatex&#8217;s restricted set, since there is no <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>equivalent), then Hyperlatex will complain, since very
probably you would also want to mark this separation in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>output. So you would have to
write

   <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-1">
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;\texonly{\bigskip}
&#x00A0;<br />&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;\htmlrule
</div>
<!--l. 140--><p class="nopar" >to imply that the separation will be a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\bigskip</span></span></span> in the printed version and a horizontal rule in the
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>-version. Even better, you could define a command <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\separate</span></span></span> in the preamble and give it a
different meaning in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">D<span 
class="small-caps">v</span><span 
class="small-caps">i</span> </span>and <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>output. If you find that for your documents <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\bigskip</span></span></span> should always
be ignored in the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>version, then you can state so in the preamble as follows. (It is also possible that
you setup personal definitions like these in your personal <span 
class="cmti-10">init.hlx </span>file, and Hyperlatex will never bother
you again.)

   <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-2">
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;\W\newcommand{\bigskip}{}
</div>
<!--l. 152--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >   This philosophy implies that in general an existing <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>-file will not make it through Hyperlatex.
In many cases, however, it will suffice to go through the file once, adding the necessary markup that
specifies how Hyperlatex should treat the unknown commands.

 id="x1-20002"></a>Using Hyperlatex</h3>
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >Using Hyperlatex is easy. You create a file <span 
class="cmti-10">document.tex</span>, say, containing your document with Hyperlatex
markup (the most important <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>-commands, with a number of additions to make it easier to create
readable <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>).
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >   If you use the command
<span class="obeylines-h">
<br /><span

class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;latex</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x00A0;document</span>
</span>
<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >then your file will be processed by <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, resulting in a <span 
class="cmcsc-10">D<span 
class="small-caps">v</span><span 
class="small-caps">i</span></span>-file, which you can print as usual.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, you can run the command
<span class="obeylines-h">
<br /><span

</span>
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent" >and your document will be converted to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>format, presumably to a set of files called <span 
class="cmti-10">document.html</span>,
<span 
class="cmti-10">document</span><span 
class="cmti-10">_1.html</span>, &#x2026;. You can then use any <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span

class="cmcsc-10"><span 
class="small-caps">w</span><span 
class="small-caps">w</span><span 
class="small-caps">w</span></span>-browser to view the document. (The
entry point for your document will be the file <span 
class="cmti-10">document.html</span>.)
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   This document describes how to use the Hyperlatex package and explains the Hyperlatex markup
language. It does not teach you <span 
class="cmti-10">how </span>to write for the web. There are style guides available, which you
might want to consult. Writing an on-line document is not the same as writing a paper. I hope that
Hyperlatex will help you to do both properly.
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >   This manual assumes that you are familiar with <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, and that you have at least some familiarity
with hypertext documents&#8212;that is, that you know how to use a <span 
class="cmcsc-10"><span 
class="small-caps">w</span><span 
class="small-caps">w</span><span 
class="small-caps">w</span></span>-browser and understand what a
<span 
class="cmti-10">hyperlink </span>is.
<!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   If you want, you can have a look at the source of this manual, which illustrates most points discussed
here. You can also look at the documents on my home page, all of which are created using
Hyperlatex.
<!--l. 202--><p class="indent" >   The primary distribution site for Hyperlatex is at http://hyperlatex.sourceforge.net, the Hyperlatex
home page.
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >   There is also a mailing list for Hyperlatex, maintained at sourceforge.net. This list is for discussion
(and support) of Hyperlatex and anything that relates to it. Instructions for subscribing are also on the
Hyperlatex home page.
<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   The FAQ and the mailing list are the only &#8220;official&#8221; place where you can find support for problems
with Hyperlatex. I am unfortunately no longer in a position to answer mail with questions
about Hyperlatex. Please understand that Hyperlatex is just a by-product of Ipe&#8211;I wrote it
to be able to write the Ipe manual the way I wanted to. I am making Hyperlatex available
because others seem to find it useful, and I&#8217;m trying to make this manual and the installation

instructions as clear as possible, but I cannot provide any personal support. If you have problems
installing or using Hyperlatex, or if you think that you have found a bug, please mail it to the
Hyperlatex mailing list. One of the friendly Hyperlatex users will probably be able to help
you.
<!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >   A final footnote: The converter to <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>implemented in Hyperlatex is written in <span 
class="cmcsc-10">G<span 
class="small-caps">n</span><span 
class="small-caps">u</span> </span>Emacs Lisp. If
you want, you can invoke it directly from Emacs (see the beginning of <span 
class="cmti-10">hyperlatex.el </span>for instructions).
But even if you don&#8217;t use Emacs, even if you don&#8217;t like Emacs, or even if you subscribe to
<span 
class="cmtt-10">alt.religion.emacs.haters</span>, you can happily use Hyperlatex. Hyperlatex can be invoked from the shell
as &#8220;hyperlatex,&#8221; and you will never know that this script calls Emacs to produce the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>
document.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >   The Hyperlatex code is based on the Emacs Lisp macros of the <span

<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" >Hyperlatex will automatically partition your input file into separate <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>files, using the sectioning
commands in the input. It attaches buttons and menus to every <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>file, so that the reader can walk
through your document and can easily find the information that she is looking for. (Note that <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>
documentation usually calls a single <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>file a &#8220;document&#8221;. In this manual we take the <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> point
of view, and call &#8220;document&#8221; what is enclosed in a <span 
class="cmtt-10">document </span>environment. We will use the term <span 
class="cmti-10">node </span>for
the individual <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>files.) You may want to experiment a bit with the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>version of this
manual. You&#8217;ll find that every <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\section</span></span></span> and <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\subsection</span></span></span> command starts a new node. The
<span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>node of a section that contains subsections contains a menu whose entries lead you
to the subsections. Furthermore, every <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>node has three buttons: <span 
class="cmti-10">Next</span>, <span 
class="cmti-10">Previous</span>, and
<span 
class="cmti-10">Up</span>.
<!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >   The <span 
class="cmti-10">Next </span>button leads you to the next section <span 
class="cmti-10">at the same level</span>. That means that if you are looking at
the node for the section &#8220;Getting started,&#8221; the <span 
class="cmti-10">Next </span>button takes you to &#8220;Conditional Compilation,&#8221; <span 
class="cmti-10">not</span>
to &#8220;Preparing an input file&#8221; (the first subsection of &#8220;Getting started&#8221;). If you are looking at
the last subsection of a section, there will be no <span 
class="cmti-10">Next </span>button, and you have to go <span 
class="cmti-10">Up </span>again,
before you can step further. This makes it easy to browse quickly through one level of detail,
while only delving into the lower levels when you become interested. (It is possible to change
this behavior so that the <span 
class="cmti-10">Next </span>button always leads to the next piece of text, see Section&#x00A0;???
)
<!--l. 271--><p class="indent" >   If you look at the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>output for this manual, you&#8217;ll find that there is one special node that acts as
the entry point to the manual, and as the parent for all its sections. This node is called the <span 
class="cmti-10">top node</span>.
Everything between <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\begin{document}</span></span></span> and the first sectioning command (such as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\section</span></span></span> or
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\chapter</span></span></span>) goes into the top node.
<!--l. 280--><p class="indent" >   An <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>file needs a <span 
class="cmti-10">title</span>. The default title is &#8220;Untitled&#8221;, you can set it to something more meaningful in
the preamble<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="hyperlatex2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3002f1"></a>
of your document using the <span 
class="cmtt-10">\htmltitle </span>command. You should use something not too long, but useful.
(The <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>title is often displayed by browsers in the window header, and is used in history lists or
bookmark files.) The title you specify is used directly for the top node of your document. The other nodes
get a title composed of this and the section heading.
<a 
 id="dx1-3003"></a>
<!--l. 295--><p class="indent" >   It is common practice to put a short notice at the end of every <span

class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>node, with a reference to the
author and possibly the date of creation. You can do this by using the <span 
class="cmtt-10">\htmladdress </span>command in the

preamble, like this:

   <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-3">

Hyperlatex should be quite limited. You mainly have to check the preamble for commands that
Hyperlatex might choke on.

concepts.
<!--l. 344--><p class="indent" >   Sooner or later Hyperlatex will fail on a <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

Hyperlatex is not meant as a general <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

class="cmcsc-10">H<span

certain subset of <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span>, and will treat all other <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> commands with an error message. This does
not mean that you should not use any of these instructions for getting exactly the printed document that
you want. By all means, do. But you will have to hide those commands from Hyperlatex using the escape
mechanisms.
<!--l. 353--><p class="indent" >   And you should learn about the commands that allow you to generate much more natural <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span

class="cmtt-10">\pageref</span></span></span> is not understood by the
Hyperlatex converter, because <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span

<span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

converter, and its <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

use it by escaping into <span class="TEX">T<span

only.

class="cmtt-10">\back</span></span></span> can be used in any mode and looks like this:
<span 
class="cmtt-10">\</span>.)
<!--l. 400--><p class="indent" >   Sometimes it is useful to turn off the special meaning of some of these ten characters. For instance,
when writing documentation about programs in&#x00A0;C, it might be useful to be able to write <span 
class="cmtt-10">some</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_variable</span>
instead of always having to type <span 
class="cmtt-10">some\</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_variable</span>. This can be achieved with the <span 
class="cmtt-10">\NotSpecial</span>
command.
<!--l. 407--><p class="indent" >   In principle, all other characters simply typeset themselves. This has to be taken with a grain of salt,
though. <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> still obeys ligatures, which turns <span 
class="cmtt-10">ffi </span>into &#8216;ffi&#8217;, and some characters, like <span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x003E;</span>, do not
resemble themselves in some fonts (<span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x003E; </span>looks like ¿ in roman font). The only characters for which this is
critical are <span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x003C;</span>, <span 
class="cmtt-10">&#x003E;</span>, and <span 
class="cmtt-10">|</span>. Better use them in a typewriter-font. Note that <span 
class="cmtt-10">?&#8216; </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">!&#8216; </span>are ligatures in any
font and are displayed and printed as <span

immediately forgotten by <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

class="E">E</span>X</span></span>&#8217;s <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

class="cmti-10">position </span>in the
document, but a certain <span 
class="cmti-10">object</span>, like a section, equation etc. It sometimes requires some care to make sure
that both the hyperlink and the printed reference point to the right place, and sometimes you will have to
place the label twice. The <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>-label tends to be placed <span

while the <span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span

class="cmti-10">after </span>the object (when the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

counter for the label). In such cases you can use the new <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>-label at
the beginning of the text, but the latex label at the end. For instance, you can correctly refer to a figure
using:

   <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-25">

&#x00A0;<br />&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;\begin{Label}{fig:wonderful}

<!--l. 1308--><p class="indent" >   A special case occurs for section headings. Always place labels <span

<span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> reference will be correct, and the Hyperlatex converter makes sure that the link will actually
lead to a point directly before the heading&#8212;so you can see the heading when you follow the
link.
<!--l. 1314--><p class="indent" >   After a while, you may notice that in certain situations Hyperlatex has a hard time dealing with a
label. The reason is that although it seems that a label marks a <span 
class="cmti-10">position </span>in your node, the <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>-tag to
set the label must surround some text. If there are other <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span></span>-tags in the neighborhood, Hyperlatex
may not find an appropriate contents for this container and has to add a space in that position (which
may sometimes mess up your formatting). In such cases you can help Hyperlatex by using the
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Label</span></span></span> environment, showing Hyperlatex how to make a label tag surrounding the text in the
environment.
<!--l. 1324--><p class="indent" >   Note that Hyperlatex uses the argument of a <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\label</span></span></span> command to produce a mnemonic <span

class="small-caps">t</span><span

<!--l. 1644--><p class="indent" >   A typical application of this command is to put a &#8220;master menu&#8221; (the analog of a table of contents) in
the top node, containing all sections of all levels of the document. This can be achieved by putting
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\htmlmenu{6}</span></span></span> in the text for the top node.
<!--l. 1649--><p class="indent" >   You can create a menu for a section other than the current one by passing the number of that section
as the optional argument, as in <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\htmlmenu[0]{6}</span></span></span>, which creates a full table of contents. (The optional
argument uses Hyperlatex&#8217;s internal numbering&#8211;not very useful except for the top node, which is always
number 0.)
<!--l. 1657--><p class="indent" >   Some people like to close off a section after some subsections of that section, somewhat like
this:

class="cmtt-10">&#x003E;</span>. This command is used in
the definition of most of Hyperlatex&#8217;s commands and environments, and you can use it yourself to achieve
effects that are not available in Hyperlatex directly. Note that <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\xml</span></span></span> looks up any attributes for the tag
that may have been set with <span 
class="cmtt-10">\xmlattributes</span>. If you want to avoid this, use the starred version
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\xml*</span></span></span>.
<!--l. 1744--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

you can include a file of <span

an extra page for every <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

extract the interesting pages into Postscript files which are then converted to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

Obviously you need to have <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

(A shellscript <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">ps2image</span></span></span> is supplied with Hyperlatex. This shellscript uses <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">ghostscript</span></span></span> to
convert the Postscript files to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">ppm</span></span></span> format, and then runs <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

argument is the name of an <span

class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>tag (in lower case!), the second argument can be used to specify
attributes for that tag. The declaration can be used in the preamble as well as in the document. A new
declaration for the same tag cancels any previous declaration, unless you use the starred version of the
command: It has effect only on the next occurrence of the named tag, after which Hyperlatex reverts to
the previous state.

   Hyperlatex&#x00A0;2.0 is a major new revision. Hyperlatex now consists of a kernel written in Emacs lisp
that mainly acts as a macro interpreter and that implements some low-level functionality. Most of the
Hyperlatex commands are now defined in the system-wide initialization file <span

much easier to customize, update, and improve Hyperlatex.

     functionality has been moved to the Hyperlatex macro level in <span 
class="cmti-10">siteinit.hlx</span>.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> The preamble is now parsed properly, and the treatment of the classes and packages with
     <span 
class="cmtt-10">\documentclass </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10">\usepackage </span>has been revised to allow for easier customization by
     loading macro packages.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Added Peter D. Mosses&#8217;s <span 
class="cmtt-10">tabbing </span>package to distribution.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Changed <span 
class="cmtt-10">ps2gif </span>to use <span 
class="cmtt-10">netpbm</span>&#8217;s version of <span 
class="cmtt-10">ppmtogif</span>, which makes <span 
class="cmtt-10">giftrans </span>unnecessary.

   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Added explanation of some features to the manual.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> The <span

class="cmti-10">sortkey@entry </span>syntax of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">makeindex</span></span></span>.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Fixed the problem that forced one to put a space at the end of commands.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> The  <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\xlabel</span></span></span> command  has  been  removed.  <span

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;1.4</span></span>
   Hyperlatex&#x00A0;1.4 introduces some incompatible changes, in particular the ten special characters. There
is support for a number of <span 
class="cmcsc-10">H<span 
class="small-caps">t</span><span 
class="small-caps">m</span><span 
class="small-caps">l</span> </span>3 features.
   <span

class="E">E</span>X</span></span>  characters  are  now  also  special  in  Hyperlatex.  However,  the
     <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\NotSpecial</span></span></span> command can be used to make characters non-special.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Some non-standard-<span class="LATEX">L<span class="A">A</span><span class="TEX">T<span 
class="E">E</span>X</span></span> commands (such as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

     recognized by Hyperlatex to be more like standard Latex.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> The <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">\htmlmathitalics</span></span></span> command has disappeared (it&#8217;s now the default, unless we use <span

     tags.)
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Within the <span

   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Added the starred versions of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

class="cmtt-10">\xlink*</span></span></span>.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Added <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

   <span

class="cmtt-10">\newcommand</span></span></span>.
   <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2219;</span> Added <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

   Hyperlatex&#x00A0;1.2 has a few new options that allow you to better use the extended <span

class="small-caps">m</span><span

   <span

     extended.
   <span

   <span
